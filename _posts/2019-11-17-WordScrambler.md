One exercise I use to encourage correct spelling when learning words is word scrambler puzzles. The only problem is that I find myself frequently formatting and thinking about the order of each individual word each time. So I decided to automate it!

**Like this:**
1. goat		→		ogta 	
2. bear		→		baer
3. dingo	→		ogind
4. fish		→		isfh

To use it, put in the words that you want scrambled followed by a line and then press <b>Scramble!</b>. It will download an rtf file that can be opened in word.

Try it down below!
