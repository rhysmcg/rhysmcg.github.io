This project is designed to help learners distinguish words that may sound similar. For example: "right" and "light", "walk" and "woke"

While in Japan, I wanted to help students understand listening to distinguish sounds before trying to make them. If the learner is able to hear and distinguish 100% of the words in each set, the next step would be to work on pronouncing the differences. That may be a future project to work on!

It was fun to use in class and I'm happy to share it here üòÅ
