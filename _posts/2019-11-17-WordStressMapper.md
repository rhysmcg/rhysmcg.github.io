When looking at the pronunciation of English words, it's useful to visualise it using a chart like this. This tool simply uses Chart.js to visualise English words. The data for the syllabification is from CMUDict but another dataset had to be supplemented to allow the syllabification of words rather than pronunciaiton symbols. There are occasional errors and sentences are beta stages! But for most words it should work well.

I added the screenshot function below because when I wanted to share  word pronunciations, I found it easier to just copy and paste, rather than screenshotting and cropping each time.

**Here are some 6 syllable words to try**

- Communication
- Revolutionary
- Responsibility
- Autobiography
